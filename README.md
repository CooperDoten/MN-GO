## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

I am incredibly passionate about Minnesota and all of the beauty that the landscape provides. It is in that spirit that I created the app "MN GO". This app makes it possible for a user to view all state parks in Minnesota that they can camp at and book a trip to that state park. Additionally, users can view all previously created trips, comment or delete a trip from their 'My Trips' view.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)


## Installation

1. Create a database named `MN_GO`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal, this command will open up a new browser tab for you!
